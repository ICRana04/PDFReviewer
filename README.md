# PDFReviewer
An Google Generative AI based application to use the open Gemini LLM model to get a response based on a customized input. The script helps load a PDF and review it based on the input prompt given to the model. The idea is to provide guidelines on the review as input and then use AI as a Reviewer for the doc. Responses are displayed as text output.
